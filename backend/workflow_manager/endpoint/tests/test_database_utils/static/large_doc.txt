There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a \nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk \nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other \ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its \nforecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. \n\nTo protect the Company\'s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign \nexchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these \ninstruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the \nCompany is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 19 \nyears. \n\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from \ncertain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by \nthe remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. \n\n                                                 Apple Inc.

The Company purchases these \ncomponents directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, \nthe Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are \nsold by the Company. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of \ntotal vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 50% and 20%.

Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") contain forward-looking statements, within \nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking \nstatements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does \nnot directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future \nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company\'s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. \nForward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as "future," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," \n"intends," "plans," "predicts," "will," "would," "could," "can," "may," and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not \nguarantees of future performance and the Company\'s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the \nforward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, \nItem 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors." The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any \nforward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. \n\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company\'s fiscal calendar, and references to \nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company\'s fiscal years ended in September and the associated \nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission (the "SEC") and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, \nItem 1 of this Form 10-Q. \n\nAvailable Information \nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor \nrelations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, \ninformation on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company\'s annual meeting of \nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this \nfiling. Further, the Company\'s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\'s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nFiscal Period \nThe Company\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is \nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which \noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\'s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. \n\nQuarterly Highlights \nThe Company\'s first quarter of 2024 included 13 weeks, compared to 14 weeks during the first quarter of 2023. \n\nThe Company\'s total net sales increased 2% or $2.4 billion during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in \n2023, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of iPad and Wearables, \nHome and Accessories. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company announced an updated MacBook Pro® 14-in., MacBook Pro 16-in. and iMac®. \n\nThe Company repurchased $20.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during \nthe first quarter of 2024. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly \nimpacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company\'s results of operations and financial condition. \n\n                                             Apple Inc.

ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid \ndisclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The \nCompany will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026. ASU 2023-09 allows for adoption using either a prospective or \nretrospective transition method. \n\nSegment Reporting \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment \nDisclosures ("ASU 2023-07\'), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly \nprovided to the Company\'s chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to \ndisclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment \nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources.

("Epic") filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the "District Court") \nagainst the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\'s unfair competition law based upon the \nCompany\'s operation of its App Store®. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to \nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic\'s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\'s App Store \nReview Guidelines violate California\'s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting \ndevelopers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app \npurchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS® App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the "Circuit Court") affirmed the District Court\'s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and \nEpic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied \nboth petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple\'s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court (the "Supreme Court"). On January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court denied both the Company\'s and Epic\'s \npetitions and the stay terminated. The Supreme Court\'s denial of Epic\'s petition confirms the District Court\'s ruling in favor of the \nCompany with respect to all of the antitrust claims. Following termination of the stay, the Company implemented a plan to comply \nwith the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the District Court. On January 31, 2024, Epic filed a notice with the \nDistrict Court indicating its intent to dispute the Company\'s compliance plan. \n\nMasimo \nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, "Masimo") filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade \nCommission (the "ITC") alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen \nfeature in Apple Watch® Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to \nthe U.S. of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a \nlimited exclusion order (the "Order") prohibiting importation and sales in the U.S. of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen \nsensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra™ 2. The Company subsequently proposed a \nredesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the "CBP") and appealed \nthe Order. On January 12, 2024, the CBP found that the Company\'s proposed redesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple \nWatch Ultra 2 falls outside the scope of the Order, permitting the Company to import and sell the models in the U.S. \n\nOther Legal Proceedings \nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in \nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company\'s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is \ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above \nmanagement\'s expectations, the Company\'s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially \nadversely affected. \n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors \n\nThe Company\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the \nheading "Risk Factors." When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\'s business, reputation, \nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, \nthere have been no material changes to the Company\'s risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K. \n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory \nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, \ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes \nin the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers \nwithin apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. \n\n                                             Apple Inc. I Q1 2024 Form 10-Q | 19 \n<<<\n\n\n In January 2024, the Company announced changes to iOS, the App Store and Safari® in the European Union to comply with the \n Digital Markets Act (the "DMA"), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS apps, alternative methods of \n distribution for iOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\'s operating systems, and additional tools \n and application programming interfaces ("APIs") for developers. Although the Company\'s compliance plan is intended to address \n the DMA\'s obligations, it is still subject to potential challenge by the European Commission or private litigants. In addition, other \n jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company \n in the European Union are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks the DMA poses to European Union users, many \n risks will remain. \n\n The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in \n legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact \n on the Company\'s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of \n investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse \nfindings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes \n to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\'s business, results of operations and \n financial condition. \n\n Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become \n subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the \n Company\'s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\'s business, \n results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other \n companies to offer their search services on the Company\'s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are \n currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. \n\n There can be no assurance the Company\'s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by \nthe outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\'s \n business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact \n the reputation of the Company\'s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the \n Company\'s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\'s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market \n acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. \n\n Item 2.
