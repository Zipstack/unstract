        Copy a file from a source storage to one or more paths in a destination
        storage. This function reads the source file in chunks and writes each chunk to
        the specified destination paths. The function will continue until the
        entire source file is copied.

        Args:
            source_storage (FileStorage): The storage object from which
                the file is read.
            destination_storage (FileStorage): The storage object to which
                the file is written.
            source_path (str): The path of the file in the source storage.
            destination_paths (list[str]): A list of paths where the file will be
                copied in the destination storage.
            chunk_size (int, optional): The number of bytes to read per chunk.
                Default is 4096 bytes.
