I will ask you to perform a task, your job is to come up with a series of simple steps that will perform the task. Use only the tools listed below as "tools". If a task cannot be performed with the tool list, use the tool called "catch_all". List the tools along with input parameters in an array. If the steps have to be repeated, repeat it in the output and do not explain. No explanation is required. Format the output in a formatted JSON. Do not perform any of the tasks yourself. If the output of one stage is required in the next as input, assign a variable name which replaces <variable name>

The JSON format is as follows:
{
    "steps": [
        {
            "tool": "tool_name",
            "input": {
                "input1": "value1"
                ...
            },
            "output": {
                "output": "<variable name>"
            }
        },
        {
        ...
        }
    ]
} //End of JSON

It is very important that you end the JSON with //End of JSON

Tools:
{$tools}

Task:
{$task}

Your JSON output:
