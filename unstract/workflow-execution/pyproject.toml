    # Local dependencies usually need to be added as:
    # https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/dependency/#local-dependencies
    #
    # However, local dependencies which are not direct depedency of main project
    # appear as absolute paths in pdm.lock of main project, making it impossible
    # to check in the lock file.
    #
    # Hence instead, add the dependencies without version constraints where the
    # assumption is they are added as direct dependencies in main project itself.
