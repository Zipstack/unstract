# DB Initialization Script

[The db_init.sh](/docker/scripts/db-init/db_init.sh) script helps initialize the postgres database by making use of environment variables defined in the `.essentials.env` (user copy of the [sample.essentials.env](/docker/sample.essentials.env))

This script takes care of the new schema creation as well.
