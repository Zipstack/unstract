"""Executor-RPC transport routing for the PG path — workers side (Phase 9, ③b-2).

The workers-side twin of ``backend/pg_queue/executor_rpc.py``. The executor "RPC"
is a synchronous request-reply: a caller (here, the ``structure_tool`` task in the
file_processing worker) sends an ``ExecutionContext`` to the executor worker and
blocks for the ``ExecutionResult``. The legacy transport is Celery — the SDK
``ExecutionDispatcher`` (``send_task`` + ``AsyncResult.get``). This module adds a
**parallel** Postgres transport that leaves Celery and the SDK completely
untouched (no SDK edit, no change to the ``execute_extraction`` task or the Celery
executor worker):

- :class:`PgExecutionDispatcher` enqueues ``execute_extraction`` onto the PG queue
  (via :class:`~queue_backend.pg_queue.client.PgQueueClient`) with a unique
  ``reply_key`` and polls ``pg_task_result`` (via
  :class:`~queue_backend.pg_queue.result_backend.PgResultBackend`) for the reply —
  same ``.dispatch()`` contract as the SDK dispatcher (never raises;
  failure/timeout → ``ExecutionResult.failure``). The already-running
  ``worker-pg-executor`` consumer runs the task and writes the reply, so this side
  only adds the enqueue + poll halves.
- :func:`resolve_executor_transport` is the gate: master
  ``PG_QUEUE_TRANSPORT_ENABLED`` (env, the workers analogue of the backend's
  Django setting) then the **single** Flipt flag ``pg_queue_enabled`` — the same
  flag the execution path uses, so one flip turns the whole PG-queue feature
  on/off. Fails closed to Celery.
- :class:`RoutingExecutionDispatcher` is what ``structure_tool`` gets from
  :func:`get_executor_dispatcher`: ``dispatch()`` picks PG-vs-Celery **per call**
  (read at dispatch time → flipping the flag is an instant, no-redeploy
  rollout/rollback); ``dispatch_async`` / ``dispatch_with_callback`` always
  delegate to Celery (the callback path is a later slice).

Zero-regression: gate off ⇒ every method delegates to the unchanged Celery
``ExecutionDispatcher`` and no ``pg_task_result`` row is created.

TODO(shared): ``resolve_executor_transport`` and the reply_key/poll orchestration
mirror the backend module almost verbatim — only the transport primitives differ
(psycopg2 here vs Django ORM there). A later slice can lift the shared logic into
``unstract.core`` so the gate/contract lives in one place.
