## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Python developers need a generic task queue abstraction library that provides a unified interface for task execution across multiple backends (Celery, Hatchet, Temporal), enabling backend switching through configuration without code changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer defines a task using `@task` decorator, **When** they submit it using `backend.submit()`, **Then** the task executes on the configured backend (Celery, Hatchet, or Temporal) without code changes
2. **Given** a developer switches backend configuration from "celery" to "temporal", **When** they restart their application, **Then** the same task code runs on Temporal instead of Celery
3. **Given** a worker starts up, **When** it initializes, **Then** it registers all task definitions with the configured backend and starts the appropriate worker loop
4. **Given** a task completes execution, **When** the developer calls `backend.get_result(task_id)`, **Then** they receive consistent result format regardless of which backend executed the task

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a task backend becomes unavailable during task execution?
- How does the system handle backend-specific configuration errors?
- What occurs when a task is submitted but no workers are running for that backend?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a unified task interface that works across Celery, Hatchet, and Temporal backends
- **FR-002**: System MUST support backend selection through configuration without requiring code changes
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable task registration using decorator pattern (`@task`) that works across all backends
- **FR-004**: System MUST support task submission with consistent API (`backend.submit(task_name, *args, **kwargs)`) regardless of backend
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide task result retrieval with consistent interface (`backend.get_result(task_id)`) across backends
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable worker process startup that automatically registers tasks and runs appropriate backend worker loop
- **FR-007**: System MUST support linear task workflows (sequential task chaining) as composition of individual tasks
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide backend-agnostic error handling and retry mechanisms
- **FR-009**: System MUST support all three target backends: Celery, Hatchet, and Temporal with equal priority
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain task state and execution context consistently across backend implementations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TaskBackend**: Abstract interface defining core operations (register_task, submit, get_result, run_worker) that all backend adapters implement
- **Task**: Individual executable unit registered via decorator pattern and submitted for execution
- **TaskResult**: Standardized result format containing task output, status, and execution metadata across all backends
- **BackendAdapter**: Concrete implementations (CeleryBackend, HatchetBackend, TemporalBackend) that implement TaskBackend interface
- **BackendConfig**: Configuration object containing backend-specific connection parameters and settings
- **TaskRegistry**: Registry of all registered tasks available for submission and execution
- **WorkerService**: Service that loads configured backend and runs appropriate worker loop (task-backend)
